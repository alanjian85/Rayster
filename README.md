# Rayster
Rayster is an out-of-box software rendering demo that shows how programming language and mathematics combined in a basic technique of Computer Graphics, Rasterization, expanded in KISS style(Keep it simple, stupid). 

## C++ standard compliant
This demo doesn't use any third-party libraries for rendering and image processing, and the only thing required is a C++17-compliant compiler, therefore it should compile well and run without any invalid operations on mainstream platforms.

## Prior Knowledge
1. Familiar with modern C++
2. Basic linear algebra, geometry and trigonometry
3. Have dealt with multi-thread programs

## Rendering in One Hour
Coming soon.
