# Box
Box is an software rendering demo which shows how programming language and mathematics are applied in a basic technique of CG(computer graphics), rasterization, it doesn't require any dependencies other than C++ STL standard library.

## C++ standard compliant
This demo doesn't use any third-party libraries for rendering and image processing, and the only thing required is a C++17-compliant compiler, therefore it should be compiled well and runs without any undefined behaviour on mainstream platforms.

## Features
1. Triangle Rasterization
2. 2D & Cubemap texture mapping
3. Varying variables fully controlled by user
4. Wavefront OBJ model loading with material support
5. Programmable vertex/fragment shader pipeline stage
6. Optional front/back face culling
7. Depth testing
8. Directional Light Shadow mapping
9. Bloom
10. SSAO (Screen Space Ambient Occulusion)
11. Normal Mapping
12. Deferred Shading

## Prior Knowledge
1. Knowledge of Object-Oriented abstraction
2. Basic linear algebra, geometry and trigonometry
